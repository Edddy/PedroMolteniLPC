          What can I expect during the first few sessions?

        <dd class="mt-4 lg:col-span-7 lg:mt-0 space-y-4">
          <p>The first session will be similar to an intake and we will go over your goals for therapy. That will be a helpful guide for the future. If we have time, during the first session, I will start going over the theory behind EMDR.</p>
          <p>The second session will be fully dedicated to the theory and practice of EMDR. Most of the session will be dedicated to guiding you through an EMDR exercise. The objective is that by the end of the second session, you will get a theoretical understanding of EMDR, as well as a felt sense of how EMDR works.</p>
          <p>The third session will be fully dedicated to IFS. Similarly to the second session, the first part of the session will be dedicated to the theory of IFS, and the second part will be an IFS exercise, so that by the end of the session you will know how IFS works.</p>
          <p>The forth session will be a combination of EMDR and IFS as needed and by the end of the session you will have a sense of how therapy with me will feel like.</p>

      <!-- Question 2 -->
      <div class="py-8 lg:grid lg:grid-cols-12 lg:gap-8">
        <dt class="text-base/7 font-semibold text-gray-900 lg:col-span-5 dark:text-white">
          What therapy approaches do you use?
        </dt>
        <dd class="mt-4 lg:col-span-7 lg:mt-0 space-y-4">
          <p>I have been trained in Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing (EMDR), Internal Family Systems (IFS) and Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) among other modalities. I am EMDR certified by the EMDR International Association.</p>
          <p>I define myself as an IFS informed EMDR therapist. The blend of EMDR and IFS, is a central part of my practice.</p>

      <!-- Question 3 -->
      <div class="py-8 lg:grid lg:grid-cols-12 lg:gap-8">
        <dt class="text-base/7 font-semibold text-gray-900 lg:col-span-5 dark:text-white">
          How long does therapy typically take?
        </dt>
        <dd class="mt-4 lg:col-span-7 lg:mt-0 space-y-4">
          <p>The reason why I am drawn to EMDR, IFS and DBT is because I find them to be effective modalities of therapy. One EMDR research study showed that 90 percent of rape victims in the study no longer had PTSD after only three sessions.</p>
          <p>The length of therapy will be relative to your goals. Reducing how disturbing a memory is, can take a few sessions, but transforming a negative core belief, or a pattern of behavior can take longer.</p>

      <!-- Question 4 -->

          Is therapy confidential?
        </dt>
        <dd class="mt-4 lg:col-span-7 lg:mt-0">
          <p>Therapy is indeed confidential, and in fact, the confidentiality of therapy is one of its therapeutic properties. I only offer online sessions, so it will be important that you find a space to have therapy sessions that allows for confidentiality.</p>

      <!-- Question 5 -->
      <div class="py-8 lg:grid lg:grid-cols-12 lg:gap-8">
        <dt class="text-base/7 font-semibold text-gray-900 lg:col-span-5 dark:text-white">
          How can therapy help with trauma?
        </dt>
        <dd class="mt-4 lg:col-span-7 lg:mt-0 space-y-4">
          <p>I believe that trauma can affect our bodies and our brains, and it can affect how intensely we experience emotions, how disturbing memories are, and how threatening we perceive our relationships to be.</p>
          <p>An approach to therapy that has a trauma lens, and a body lens can help by restoring a sense of safety and control. For example, EMDR can help us reprocess traumatic memories and make them less disturbing. As you integrate traumatic memories into the larger narrative of your life, without being overwhelmed by them, your core belief about yourself can change to a more adaptive and regenerative belief.</p>
          <p>IFS can help us build a connection between mind and body by providing us with a way to communicate with the parts of us that are protecting us from perceived threats and the parts of us that are holding on to burdens. DBT can help us address triggers and avoidance, as well as developing new coping skills.</p>

          <p>I offer online sessions only at this point.</p>

        <dd class="mt-4 lg:col-span-7 lg:mt-0 space-y-4">
          <p>My private pay fee is $150 per session. Sessions last 50 minutes.</p>
          <p>In terms of health insurance, I am in-network with Aetna. I use Headway to process the insurance claims and I can give you an estimate of your copay ahead of time.</p>
          <p>For all other insurance companies, I can provide super-bills for reimbursement.</p>

          How can I prepare for my therapy sessions?
        </dt>
        <dd class="mt-4 lg:col-span-7 lg:mt-0 space-y-4">
          <p>To make the most out of sessions, and in preparation for therapy, I suggest reading some of the books that have been the most influential in my approach to therapy and my understanding of trauma.</p>
          <p>For example: <em>The Body Keeps the Score</em> by Bessel van der Kolk, <em>No Bad Parts</em> by Richard Schwartz, <em>EMDR</em> by Francine Shapiro, <em>Building a Life Worth Living</em> by Marsha Linehan, and <em>Full Catastrophe Living</em> by Jon Kabat-Zinn.</p>

          How do I know if therapy is right for me?
        </dt>
        <dd class="mt-4 lg:col-span-7 lg:mt-0">
          <p>I believe that trauma therapy can be transformative. If you feel like talk therapy has provided you with insight but you want to change your patterns of behavior, a more body-based modality like IFS informed EMDR could be helpful. After 4 sessions you will hopefully have a sense of how EMDR and IFS work and if it will be helpful for you.</p>
