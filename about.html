                        <p>I define myself as an IFS-informed EMDR therapist. The blend of EMDR and IFS, is a central part of my practice. In my years practicing EMDR, I have learned about the power of neuroplasticity. IFS has brought a new level of deepness to my practice.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-base font-semibold tracking-tight text-zinc-800 dark:text-zinc-100">Qualifications</h3>
                        <p>"I am licensed in the State of Pennsylvania. I have a Master’s in Counseling Psychology from Temple University. Since then I have been trained in EMDR, DBT and IFS among other modalities."</p>

                        <h3 class="text-base font-semibold tracking-tight text-zinc-800 dark:text-zinc-100">Specialties</h3>
                        <p>I work with adults and couples struggling with anxiety, depression, trauma, PTSD, emotion regulation, mindlessness, impulsivity, and relationship problems. My approach is to identify the negative core beliefs and the events that might have caused them. EMDR can be very effective in reducing the disturbance of memories. IFS can help identify blocking beliefs and parts of ourselves that might be protecting us in unhelpful ways.</p>
