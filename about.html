                        <p>I am a trauma therapist and I am trained in 3 different trauma-informed modalities, EMDR, IFS and DBT. EMDR and IFS are a central part of my practice. They are effective approaches for changing negative core beliefs about ourself, and reducing the disturbance of memories. DBT is an effective approach for emotion regulation and interpersonal effectiveness.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-base font-semibold tracking-tight text-zinc-800 dark:text-zinc-100">Qualifications</h3>
                        <p>I am licensed in Pennsylvania. I have a Master’s in Counseling Psychology from Temple University. 
                        <br />Since then I have been certified in EMDR by the EMDR International Association; and was trained in IFS and  DBT among other modalities.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-base font-semibold tracking-tight text-zinc-800 dark:text-zinc-100">Specialties</h3>
                        <p>I work with adults and couples struggling with anxiety, depression, trauma, PTSD, emotion regulation, mindlessness, impulsivity, and relationship problems. My approach is to identify the negative core beliefs and the events that might have caused them. EMDR can be very effective in reducing the disturbance of memories. IFS can help identify blocking beliefs and parts of ourselves that might be protecting us in unhelpful ways.
                        <br />DBT skills can be helpful for regulating painful emotions, identifying what we need and effectively asking for it.
